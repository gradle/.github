# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security issues to the public issue tracker.
Please send security issues to [security@gradle.com](mailto:security@gradle.com).
We do our best to get back to you by the end of the next business day.

## Security Patch Policy

For the Gradle Build Tool, it's our intention to fix security issues in our next release.
We will only backport security fixes to earlier major versions in extenuating circumstances.
